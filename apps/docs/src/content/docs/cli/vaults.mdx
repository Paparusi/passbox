## List Vaults

```bash
passbox vault list
```

Shows all vaults you have access to, with your role in each.

## Create a Vault

```bash
passbox vault create <name>
```

Creates a new vault with the given name. A default `development` environment is created automatically.

### Example

```bash
passbox vault create my-app
# ✓ Vault "my-app" created
```

## Delete a Vault

```bash
passbox vault delete <name>
```

Permanently deletes a vault and all its secrets, environments, and members. Requires `owner` role.

:::caution
This action is irreversible. All secrets in the vault will be permanently deleted.
:::

### Example

```bash
passbox vault delete old-project
# Are you sure? (y/N): y
# ✓ Vault "old-project" deleted
```

## Initialize Project

```bash
passbox init
```

Creates a `.passbox.json` file in the current directory, linking the project to a vault. You'll be prompted to select a vault from your list.

### Example `.passbox.json`

```json
{
  "vault": "my-app",
  "environment": "development"
}
```

Once initialized, you can omit the `--vault` flag from other commands:

```bash
# Before init
passbox get API_KEY --vault my-app

# After init
passbox get API_KEY
```
