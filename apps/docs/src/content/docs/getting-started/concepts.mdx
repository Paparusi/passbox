## Vaults

A **vault** is a container for secrets. Each vault has its own AES-256-GCM encryption key, which is itself encrypted with your master key.

- You can create multiple vaults (e.g., one per project or team)
- Each vault has **members** with roles: `owner`, `admin`, `member`, `viewer`
- Vault keys are shared between members using X25519 key exchange

```bash
passbox vault create my-project
passbox vault list
```

## Secrets

A **secret** is a key-value pair stored in a vault. The value is encrypted client-side before transmission.

- Secret names are case-sensitive (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `api_key`)
- Every update creates a new **version** (full version history is preserved)
- Secrets can have optional **descriptions** and **tags**

```bash
passbox set API_KEY "sk-abc123" --vault my-project
passbox get API_KEY --vault my-project
```

## Environments

**Environments** let you store different values for the same secret name across deployment stages.

- Every vault starts with a default `development` environment
- Common environments: `development`, `staging`, `production`
- The same secret name can have different values per environment

```bash
passbox environment create production --vault my-project
passbox set DATABASE_URL "postgres://prod/db" --env production
passbox set DATABASE_URL "postgres://dev/db" --env development
```

## Organizations

Every user has an **organization** (created automatically on registration). Vaults belong to organizations, and team members are invited at the vault level.

## Service Tokens

**Service tokens** (`pb_...`) provide machine-to-machine authentication for:

- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, etc.)
- MCP servers (AI agent access)
- Automated scripts

Service tokens carry an encrypted copy of the master key, allowing them to decrypt secrets without a password.

```bash
passbox token create --name "ci-deploy"
```

## Zero-Knowledge Architecture

PassBox uses a **zero-knowledge** design:

1. Your **password** is never sent to the server in raw form for key derivation
2. The **master key** is derived client-side using Argon2id
3. All **secret values** are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before leaving your device
4. **Vault keys** are shared via X25519 Diffie-Hellman key exchange
5. The **server** only stores ciphertext — it cannot decrypt your secrets

Even if the server database is fully compromised, attackers get only encrypted blobs that are computationally infeasible to decrypt without the master key.

## Recovery Key

During registration, PassBox generates a **recovery key** — a one-time backup that can restore your master key if you forget your password.

- Store it securely (password manager, safe deposit box)
- It is shown only once during registration
- Without it, a forgotten password means permanent data loss (by design)

## Plan Limits

PassBox uses an open-core model with tiered plans:

| Feature | Free | Pro | Team | Enterprise |
|---------|------|-----|------|------------|
| Vaults | 3 | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Secrets per vault | 50 | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Members per vault | 2 | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Environments per vault | 3 | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Audit retention | 7 days | 90 days | 365 days | Unlimited |
| Service tokens | 1 | 50 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
