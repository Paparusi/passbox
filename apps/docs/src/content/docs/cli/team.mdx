## Members

### List Members

```bash
passbox member list [options]
```

Lists all members of a vault with their roles.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--vault <name>` | Vault name or ID |

### Add a Member

```bash
passbox member add <email> [options]
```

Invites a user to the vault. This performs a cryptographic key exchange (X25519) to securely share the vault's encryption key with the new member.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--vault <name>` | Vault name or ID |
| `--role <role>` | Role: `viewer`, `member`, `admin` (default: `member`) |

```bash
passbox member add alice@example.com --vault my-app --role admin
```

:::note
The invited user must already have a PassBox account. The CLI uses X25519 Diffie-Hellman key exchange to share the vault key — the server never sees the vault key in plaintext.
:::

### Change Member Role

```bash
passbox member role <email> <role> [options]
```

Updates a member's role. Requires `admin` or `owner` role. Owners cannot be demoted.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--vault <name>` | Vault name or ID |

```bash
passbox member role alice@example.com admin --vault my-app
```

### Remove a Member

```bash
passbox member remove <email> [options]
```

Removes a member from the vault. Requires `admin` or `owner` role.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--vault <name>` | Vault name or ID |

```bash
passbox member remove alice@example.com --vault my-app
```

## Service Tokens

Service tokens provide machine-to-machine authentication for CI/CD, scripts, and MCP servers.

### List Tokens

```bash
passbox token list
```

Shows all service tokens for your account.

### Create a Token

```bash
passbox token create --name <name> [options]
```

Creates a new service token. The token value is shown once — save it securely.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--name <name>` | Token name (required) |
| `--permissions <perms>` | Comma-separated: `read`, `write`, `delete` (default: `read`) |
| `--vault <name>` | Scope token to a specific vault |

```bash
passbox token create --name "github-actions" --permissions read
# ✓ Token created: pb_abc123...
# Save this token — it won't be shown again.
```

### Revoke a Token

```bash
passbox token revoke <token-id>
```

Permanently revokes a service token.

```bash
passbox token revoke abc123-def456
```

### Using Service Tokens

Set the token as an environment variable:

```bash
export PASSBOX_TOKEN=pb_abc123...
passbox list  # uses token auth instead of session
```

Or use it in CI/CD:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions
env:
  PASSBOX_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PASSBOX_TOKEN }}
```
