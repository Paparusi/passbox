## Free Tier Limits

The free tier is fully functional with these limits:

- **3 vaults** — enough for personal projects
- **50 secrets per vault** — covers most applications
- **2 members per vault** — you + 1 collaborator
- **3 environments per vault** — dev, staging, production
- **7-day audit retention** — recent activity
- **1 service token** — for CI/CD or MCP

## Limit Enforcement

When you exceed a limit, the API returns a `403 PLAN_LIMIT` error:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "PLAN_LIMIT",
    "message": "Free plan allows 3 vaults. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited."
  }
}
```

Limits are enforced on:
- Vault creation
- Secret creation (single and bulk)
- Member invitations
- Environment creation
- Service token creation

Existing resources are never deleted when downgrading — you just can't create new ones until you're within limits.
